config.json is a configuration file for the site in question.

It has two keys - 'site' and 'pages'.
	'site' contains a 'title' which is used as the <title> in every page.
	
	'site' contains a 'theme' which is the theme containing master.tpl and master.scss.
	
	'site' may contain a 'additional_code' which is a python script executed in the server scope,
	you can use @route and friends here to specify custom routes and APIs.
	
	'pages' is an array depicting the available pages on the site. They are automatically added
	to the navigation bar. Each page is a hashmap/dict with the following keys:
		'title' is a string that is used on the navigation bar
		
		'path' is the path to the .tpl file, minus the actual file extension. Use a posix style path
		without a leading slash as it is also used for navigation.
		
		finally, 'link_elements' is a list of tuples to be used for additional stylesheets and more.
		Each tuple is first the type (for example stylesheet) and second is the path (for example /sass/boop.scss)
