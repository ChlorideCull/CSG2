config.json is a configuration file for the site in question.

It has three keys - 'version', 'site' and 'pages'.
	'version' is a number specifying configuration file version, this document
	details version 2.
	
	'site' is a dictionary containing the following keys:
		'title' which is used as the <title> in every page.
	
		'theme' which is the theme containing master.tpl and master.scss.

		'domain_name' which is a string that configures the nginx frontend to
		route that domain name to the correct site. If not present, it defaults
		to the site name, with slashes substituted for underscores.
		
		may contain a 'additional_code' which is a python script executed in
		the server scope, you can use csg2api.route and others here to specify
		custom routes and APIs.
	
	'pages' is an array depicting the available pages on the site. They are
	automatically added to the navigation bar. Each page is a hashmap/dict with
	the following keys:
		'title' is a string that is used on the navigation bar
		
		'path' is the path to the .tpl file, minus the actual file extension.
		Use a posix style path without a leading slash as it is also used for
		navigation.
		
		'hidden' is a boolean that specifies whether to print the page onto the
		navigation bar or not.
		
		'require_auth' is a boolean that specifies whether authentication is
		required to access the page, note that the page will error out if there
		is no authentication handler for security reasons.
		
		finally, 'link_elements' is a list of tuples to be used for additional
		stylesheets and more. Each tuple is first the type (for example
		stylesheet) and second is the path (for example /sass/boop.scss)
